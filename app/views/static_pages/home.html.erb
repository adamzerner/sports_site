<h4>What makes it unique?</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Players in team depth charts are highlighted so you see at a glance who's good on the team, who could shoot, who could defend, and how big the team is.</li>
	<li>*Written analysis of each player, so you could get an idea of what kind of player he is.</li>
	<li>Video analysis of some players, so you could see what kind of player he is.</li>
	<li>Player rankings, shooting rankings, defense rankings.</li>
	<li>Easy to understand contract information.</li>
	<li>No information overload on team/player pages.</li>
	<li>Player stats are sorted from most recent seasons to least recent seasons. Other sites do the opposite for some reason.</li>
	<br />
	<li>*Easy access to per 36 minutes and per x possessions stats.</li>
	<li>*Player measurables, like wingspan, vertical jump, 3/4 court sprint...</li>
